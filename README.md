# Mikrotik-SrctoDstIP-TrafficLimit
To limit the traffic between source and destination IP addresses, there are three scripts in this repo.
Use Script1 at the beginning of your time period.
Run Script2 regularly during the period.
Run Script3 at the end of the period.
SIP in Script1 is the source IP address which is by default set to 192.168.2.0/24.
DIP in Script1 is the destination IP address which uses 8.8.8.8 as its pre-defined value

*Minor changes are needed to define download, upload, bidirectional traffic, and multiple instance scenario.
